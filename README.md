Is a simple application where I can play with the Release Candidate of Phoenix Framework, 1.8.0-rc.

At this point, I am really interested on learn about the Scopes. Here is the [Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.8.0-rc.0/Phoenix.Scope.html). As by the release post, "Scopes provide a foundation for building multi-tenant, team-based, or session-isolated apps, slot cleanly into the router and LiveView lifecycle".

I am using this application to walk through the these possibilies.

### Installation

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
